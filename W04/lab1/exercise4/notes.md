# Exercise 4
### Implement a perceptron to learn to classify breast cancer data set using pythonâ€™s Scikit-Learn library

So this uses a dataset for breast cancer

we again randomly initalise weights, and update it using the stochastic gradient descent

we also predict based of the activiation and then comapre these with the expected outputs to return the accuracy
